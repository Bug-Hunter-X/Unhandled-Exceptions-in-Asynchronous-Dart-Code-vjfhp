# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart:  unhandled exceptions within asynchronous operations using `async` and `await`.  The provided code attempts to fetch data from a URL, but lacks comprehensive error handling. 

**Problem:** The original code only partially handles exceptions. While it catches exceptions within the `fetchData` function, it doesn't always prevent the application from crashing or failing silently.

**Solution:** The solution demonstrates robust error handling, using `try-catch` blocks to handle various potential exceptions (e.g., network errors, JSON decoding errors), along with informative error messages.
